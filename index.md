# Welcome

DevelopSpace is a non-profit organization dedicated to helping build the scientific and technical 
foundations for human space activities through open source development methods. DevelopSpace engages 
in research and educational endeavors with a focus on open sharing of relevant scientific and technical 
resources, and fostering related activities and innovations. DevelopSpace enables a wide variety of
individuals and groups to participate in the exploration, development, and utilization of space.

This website is currently being rebuilt as we migrate content from 
[wiki.developspace.net](https://wiki.developspace.net/). We have an early paper describing the overall 
[DevelopSpace concept](https://wiki.developspace.net/w/images/6/68/AIAA2007-OpeningSpaceforHumanity.pdf) -- 
while both the space community and open source development have evolved significantly since 
it was originally published, many of the items it outlined still hold.

## What we do

DevelopSpace supports projects engaged in open source space development, including through advising, 
financial support, and project hosting resources. We also provide open access scientific and 
technical content through our online library.

## How to help

We are seeking volunteers in a number of areas, including project advisors and reviewers, content
authoring, library curation, and web development. Please contact us via 
[info@developspace.org](mailto:info@developspace.org) for more information.

Donations are greatly appreciated, and can be made
