# Welcome

DevelopSpace is a non-profit organization dedicated to building the scientific and technical foundations for human space activities through open source development methods.

This website is currently being rebuilt as we migrate content from [wiki.developspace.net](https://wiki.developspace.net/).

## What we do

DevelopSpace supports projects engaged in open source space development, including through advising, financial support, and project hosting resources. We also provide open access scientific and technical content through our online library.

## How to help

We are seeking volunteers in a number of areas, including project advisors and reviewers, content authoring, library curation, and web development. Please contact us via [info@developspace.org](mailto:info@developspace.org) for more information.

Donations are greatly appreciated, and can be made [via PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&hosted_button_id=HJZT7DT5GJ8UC) or check, see the [about page](about) for more information.
