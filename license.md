# Open Licensing

DevelopSpace is committed to the open development of space, including
distributing material in an open manner. We follow the [Open Definition](https://opendefinition.org/) 
principles in defining openness, including that:

> Open means anyone can freely access, use, modify, and share for any
purpose (subject, at most, to requirements that preserve provenance and
openness).

We see this openness as offering significant benefits for space development, 
helping to accelerate progress in a number of areas and broaden the awareness
and support for the development of space. Open-sharing of information can increase
the amount of review and feedback on the provided information, and help
faciltate others building on prior work rather than having to reinvent things
that have been done before. Freely-accessible information also helps people from
a wide variety of backgrounds learn about space science and engineering, and discover
ways in which they can contribute.

This page describes the overarching license for content on our website,
along with providing general guidance on selecting a license for
new material and projects.

# DevelopSpace Content

Unless otherwise specified, all content on DevelopSpace.org is licensed under the
[Creative Commons Attribution license (`CC-BY-4.0`)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). 
A copy of the [license text](../LICENSE.txt) is available. This license
enables reusers to distribute, remix, adapt, and build upon the material in any medium or format, so long
as attribution is given to the creator. Attribution can be provided by linking to the relevant page on DevelopSpace.org.

User contributed content can have an altenative license, see further information below. If no alternative 
license is specified the content is contributed according to the `CC-BY-4.0` license. Please be aware of 
and appropriately capture the license status of any third-party content being added to our site, including 
the specific Creative Commons license (there are several) if the content uses one of them. 
We also host works that are in the [public domain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) rather than 
being licensed, including works of the United States government.

Content on [wiki.developspace.net](https://wiki.developspace.net/) was publicly posted however not
explicitly licensed. Contact us if you want to reproduce any of the content and we can help with 
appropriate permissions.

License information for software source code is captured in the respective software files.

# Selecting a License

There are a large number of open source and open content licenses available,
see for example lists from
[GitHub's Choose a License project](https://choosealicense.com/appendix/),
the [Free Software Foundation](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html),
and the [Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/licenses). This section
tries to provide high-level guidance on selecting a license, noting that
there are several pros and cons to various licenses and we do not provide
legal advice. Feel free to [contact us](mailto:info@developspace.org)
to discuss any of these matters.

A key distinction within open licenses is whether or not derivatives need to be licensed
under the same or similar license as the work from which they are derived. Licenses
without such requirements are typically considered "permissive", while those with such
restrictions are often described as "share-alike", "reciprocal", or "copyleft" (reversing the idea of
copyright). Some licenses also cover patents for the subject work, while others do not. 

Note that some licenses don't meet the definitions of free- or open-licenses as they
prevent modifications (such as having a "no-derivatives" clause) or prevent use for 
certain purposes (such as including a "non-commercial" clause). While we
allow existing content to be shared on DevelopSpace under such licenses we
generally discourage the creation of new content using them, with the exception
of the use of "no-derivatives" licenses for content which is primarily 
[stating an opinion](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html#OpinionLicenses) and
isn't intended to be built upon.

The `license identifiers` on this page are based on the [SPDX License List](https://spdx.org/licenses/), 
which provides a standardized way of referring to licenses.

### Documents, Data, Media and Other Content

[Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/) created a set of licenses 
and a public domain dedication to allow for the open sharing of creative works protected by copyright.
We generally recommend the Creative Commons By-Attribution `CC-BY-4.0` license as a permissive license 
which still calls for attribution and is the 
base license for content on DevelopSpace.org. If no attribution is desired and you want to minimize
restrictions, the Creative Commons `CC0-1.0` public domain dedication can be used. Alternatively, 
if you want attribution and for modifications to be shared under the same license, you can use the 
Creative Commons By-Attribution, Share-Alike `CC-BY-SA-4.0` license, which
is the primary license used by [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Copyrights).

### Software

The vast majority of open licenses are targetted at software development,
including many project-specific licenses. Organizations such as the
Free Software Foundation and Open Source Initiative have worked to
communicating the benefits and drawbacks of various licenses and to
standardize the use of open licenses.

For DevelopSpace projects, we recommend the Apache Public License 2.0 (`Apache-2.0`)
as a permissive license or the GNU General Public License version 3 or later (`GPL-3.0-or-later`) for a strong copyleft
(reciprocal) license, both of which address copyright and patents. The MIT License
(`MIT`, sometimes called Expat) is a simple, permissive license although only it covers
copyright matters and not patents.

### Hardware

Many open source hardware projects use one or more of the licenses described above. 
The [Arduino project](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/4415094490770-Licensing-for-products-based-on-Arduino) uses the `CC-BY-SA-4.0` license for its hardware, as an example, while other projects use `GPL-3.0` or `Apache-2.0` licenses.

A number of hardware-specific licenses have also been developed. The Solderpad 
Hardware License v2.1 exception to the Apache 2.0 license improves its coverage
for hardware (`Apache-2.0 WITH SHL-2.1`), while maintaining its permissive nature.
CERN has developed a series of open hardware licenses ranging from permissive 
(`CERN-OHL-P-2.0`) to strongly reciprocal (`CERN-OHL-S-2.0`).
