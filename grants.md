# Overview

DevelopSpace is initiating a grants program to support projects working in relevant science
and engineering areas that share their results and methods in an open manner.

We intend to request grant applications on a periodic basis, with funding opportunities
two to three times per year. You can sign up to receive updates on our grant program and 
DevelopSpace more generally through the link at the bottom of this page.

**Grant applications are now open! Please review the information below and then fill out
the [grant application form](https://forms.gle/4JMaX9CS843FJmEZ7).** Applications are
due by September 20, 2025 at 8 pm US CDT (GMT-05) in order to be considered for the
current round. Earlier applications are encouraged.

# Topic Areas

Our first round of grants is focused on work that contributes to the human exploration
and development of Mars, including science and engineering work associated with Mars
surface resources and operations. Work that is relevant to both Mars and the Moon, and 
potentially a broader set of destinations, is also supported. 

In general, we are interested in supporting work that will have ongoing value and that
can be built upon further after the grant effort. Work can be novel research or take the form of
reviewing and summarizing prior work and providing information in a form that can be leveraged
by other efforts moving forward. Developing and publishing relevant tools and databases 
is also supported. Education-focused activities should have ongoing value beyond the grant 
period, including for those who were not directly engaged in the supported effort.

Example topics that are of particular interest are as follows, noting that grant proposals
do not need to be limited to items on this list:

* Mars surface environments and hardware design guidelines
* Mars resource availability and processing, including both water and non-water resources
* Evaluation of candidate landing sites and outpost locations, and associated surface operations
* Power generation and energy storage, including methods that leverage local resources
* Methods to leverage human missions and precursor activities to enhance the science and
exploration of Mars, including approaches to Mars surface science with humans present
* Long-range, regional- and global-scale surface mobility and exploration capabilities

We encourage applications from areas outside of traditional aerospace and planetary science fields,
including those looking to apply terrestrial technologies towards Mars surface development.
DevelopSpace can provide advisory support on applicability of particular approaches towards
Mars exploration and development, and key questions to address.

# Funding

DevelopSpace anticipates initial funding will be between $500 and $2,500 per grant, with
the award amount dependent on the size of the activity and ongoing value of the material
developed through the course of the effort. The funds can be used in a variety of ways
to best enable the goals of the project and support our mission, including but not limited
to research expenses, travel costs, food for team activities, and modest stipends. In cases
where available funding is unable to cover the full costs of an activity, the funds can
be used to complement other support and we may be able to help secure additional funds.

In addition to monetary support, a variety of in-kind contributions can potentially be 
provided by DevelopSpace in collaboration with the project. Examples could include
data storage and computing resources, technical and scientific review and advice,
and assistance with broader fundraising and project administration activities.

Proposals are encouraged globally, although US Government regulations may limit what
entities can be supported. Support for non-US entities may require additional 
time to coordinate transfer of funds if selected.

The [grant application](https://forms.gle/4JMaX9CS843FJmEZ7) is available through Google Forms; 
a Google account is not required in order to apply. Please reach out to us via email at 
[info@developspace.org](mailto:info@developspace.org) for any questions throughout the process.
